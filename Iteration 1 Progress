As a first step, We chose the TSN R50 pre-trained model fine-tuned on the HMDB51 dataset for human activity recognition from the MMACTION2 repository, including gym exercises.

Steps:
Clone the mmaction2 repository.
Installing the necessary dependencies and libraries required for running the pre-trained TSN model. This includes Python, PyTorch, OpenCV, and MMACTION2.
Download the pre-trained TSN model from the MMACTION2 repository.Then loading the model using PyTorch.
Specify the device on which you want to run the model (CPU or GPU). (We used google collab (GPU runtime).
Specify the classes to track and initialize rep counts. (Bicep Curls, Squats and Pushups)
Capture video frames: To track the user's movements, capture video frames using the device camera.
Process the video frames: Once you have captured the video frames, you can process them using the pre-trained TSN model.
The model will analyze the frames and classify the user's movements as per the exercise in progress.
