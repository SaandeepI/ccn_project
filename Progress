As per the iteration plan, we have researched several ways to implement this project. 
We looked into the possibility of implementing this using Mediapipe, ml5.js PseNet and MMAction2 TSN Model, 
where we found that MMAction2 TSN Model or PoseNet can be a good choice for implementing pose estimation for the gym activities. 

Building a basic gym tracker using pre-trained MMAction2 models in a client-server architecture involves several steps, to start off
with the networking part we have drafted a blue print of what can be done in client server architecture.

Here are the steps:

Server-Side Implementation-
Installing frameworks, as of now we want to use Flask to handle HTTP client requests.
Loading the pre trained model
Define API endpoints to receive video data from client
Using the model, recognize and monitor the exercise performed
Return the results to client as HTTP responses

Client Side Implementation-
Build web page to capture video data
Send video to server using HTTP requests
Display the requests
