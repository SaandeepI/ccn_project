Project Title: Personalized AI Gym Tracker based on Pose Estimation

Introduction:

In this project, we aim to develop and deploy an AI pose estimation model specially for Gym Workouts. AI gym tracker based on pose estimation is a cutting-edge technology that uses artificial intelligence to track and monitor the physical movements of individuals during
exercise. This innovative solution leverages deep learning models to estimate the poses of people in real-time, providing valuable insights into the effectiveness of 
their workout routine. With the ability to provide accurate, data-driven feedback, an AI gym tracker has the potential to revolutionize the way people approach fitness, 
empowering them to optimize their workouts and reach their goals faster."

Architecture intended to use:

In this project, we intend to use a client-server architecture. If the main goal is achieved we will also proceed with developing a mobile application.

Project Plan:

1. Gathering all the resources required and focus more on the available AI models and figure out the blueprint.
2. Starting with the basics, capturing the live video, Preparing the Environment, Setting up a suitable environment for deploying the model, such as a cloud server
   or a local machine with the necessary hardware and software requirements.
3. Load the Pre-trained Model: Load the pre-trained pose estimation model into the environment. To find a model which is compatible with the framework and is used
   for training, such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
